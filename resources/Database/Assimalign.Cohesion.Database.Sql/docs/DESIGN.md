# Assimalign.Cohesion.Database.Sql — Design

The SQL engine (area architecture: [resources/Database/DESIGN.md](../../DESIGN.md)
§3.3): parse (`Sql.Language`) → plan (`SqlPlanner`) → execute (`SqlPlanExecutor`)
against shared storage, with the catalog (`Sql.Catalog`) as schema authority.

## Execution model

- **Rule-based planning, plan/execute split.** `SqlPlanner` binds the AST against
  the catalog into a small `SqlPlan` IR and rejects everything outside the
  executor's surface *at plan time with precise messages* (JOIN, GROUP BY,
  subqueries, aggregates beyond a lone `COUNT(*)`, `INSERT ... SELECT`). The IR
  is deliberately thin — a cost-based planner replaces the binding internals
  later without changing the executor seam (#178's plan-stage requirement, MVP
  shape).
- **Row format: MVCC stamps + object-id-prefixed tuple (record-space format
  version 2).** Every data record is `[writer u64][deleter u64]` — a fixed
  16-byte version-stamp header, the B+Tree leaf-entry design adopted for the
  record space — followed by the shared tuple codec payload (#854): the owning
  table's object id, then one self-describing component per column. Why a fixed
  binary prefix and not tuple components (the rejected alternative): (a) stamps
  in front never disturb ADD COLUMN's O(1) null-tail decode, which depends on
  missing components being *trailing*; (b) fixed width makes tombstoning a
  same-length in-place write — a delete can never relocate a record; (c) stamp
  reads don't pay tuple-decode costs on the scan hot path. All tables of a
  database share one record space and scans decode-and-filter by the object-id
  prefix. Per-object page chains are a later storage feature; the row format
  doesn't change for it.
- **Scans are snapshot-visible.** Every scan filters through the statement's
  snapshot: a version is visible when `IsVisible(writer)` and its deleter — when
  stamped — is *not* admitted (a visible tombstone reads as absence). Updates
  write version chains in the record space itself: tombstone the old version in
  place, insert the new one, both stamped with the writing transaction's
  sequence — so exactly one version of a logical row is visible per snapshot by
  construction, versions are WAL-covered like all record writes (restart keeps
  them correct for free), and aborted stamps revert physically with the page
  images. Deletes tombstone (older snapshots keep the row until the purge
  worker reclaims below every live horizon). DDL row rewrites (DROP COLUMN)
  walk *every* stored version, visible or not, preserving stamps.
- **Migration rule (record-space format version, catalog-persisted).** The
  catalog stores the record-space format version (kind-4 record): 1 = the
  pre-MVCC unstamped layout, 2 = stamped. A version-1 database upgrades in
  place at open — every record gains a zeroed stamp header (writer 0 =
  committed bootstrap data, visible to every snapshot) under one storage
  transaction, marker written after. The upgrade is idempotent across the
  two-storage crash window because a version-1 record always begins with the
  tuple codec's nonzero Int64 tag byte, so an already-stamped record (16 zero
  bytes in front) is provably upgraded and skipped on replay.
- **Schema evolution:** `ADD COLUMN` is O(1) — missing trailing components decode
  as null; `DROP COLUMN` rewrites the table's rows (positional records), inside
  the caller's transaction.
- **Expression evaluation** is interpretive with SQL null propagation (nulls
  reject predicates, comparisons with null are null, `AND`/`OR` are three-valued),
  numeric promotion to decimal, ordinal string comparison, hand-rolled `LIKE`
  (`%`/`_`), `CASE`, `BETWEEN`, `IN` (lists), `IS NULL`, parameters (`@name`
  bound by bare name), and a small builtin set (`COALESCE`, `UPPER`, `LOWER`,
  `LENGTH`, `ABS`). Compiled expression plans are a later optimization.
- **SELECT materializes.** Sorting and `DISTINCT` need the full result anyway at
  this stage; `SqlMaterializedResultSet` carries typed columns and evaluated
  rows. Streaming operators arrive with the planner build-out.
- **Transactions (MVCC session binding, §3.8 step 1).** Every statement —
  explicit transaction or auto-commit — runs under an `ITransactionContext`
  from the database's transaction manager, paired one-to-one with a storage
  bracket that **adopts the manager's sequence** (one namespace: the bracket's
  commit record proves the logical transaction at recovery). The per-database
  `SqlTransactionCoordinator` owns the composition (manager + lock manager +
  version store + journal-bound log) and implements `IStorageTransactionSource`,
  the pairing seam. Commit/rollback flow through the *manager*: its journal-bound
  log resolves the paired bracket, so after-images precede the commit record and
  the durability await honors the engine's grouped/synchronous policy; rollback
  restores page images and purges the writer from the version store. Auto-commit
  statements ride a one-statement manager transaction, so visibility semantics
  never fork. Isolation: `Snapshot` (default) fixes the statement snapshot at
  begin, `ReadCommitted` re-captures per statement (the statement scope captures
  `context.Snapshot` exactly once per statement); `Serializable` is **rejected**
  until conflict detection exists (never run weaker than requested). Kernel
  aborts surface wrapped in the root's `DatabaseTransactionAbortedException`.
  On every database open the coordinator runs `TransactionRecovery.Analyze`
  over the recovered journal (the storage strategy defers the open-time
  checkpoint for exactly this) and drives `IVersionStore.PurgeWriterAsync` for
  every unproven sequence; the checkpoint worker checkpoints data storages
  *through the coordinator*, so truncating checkpoint records carry in-flight
  logical sequences. DDL flows to the catalog, which self-commits on its own
  storage (see the catalog DESIGN.md for why DDL-in-DML is out of MVP scope).
- **Two file sets per database:** `<name>` (data) and `<name>.catalog` — both via
  the engine's storage strategy, so file-backed and in-memory composition stays
  symmetric.

## Engine-owned background workers

The engine is a **data machine**: `Create(options)` returns it operational, with
the five-worker inventory already pumping — one dedicated background thread per
worker, spawned by the constructor and joined on dispose. Nothing outside the
engine schedules, claims, or configures these loops (the 2026-07-13 redesign
deleted the #902 claim handshake — see the root DESIGN.md); the root contract's
`IDatabaseEngineWorker` view of them is observational (name, kind, cadence).
Each worker iterates a lock-free snapshot of every open storage file set (data +
catalog per database, rebuilt when databases open/close; passes tolerate racing
a drop):

- **`SqlWriteAheadFlushWorker`** — signal-driven group-commit flusher. Every open
  storage's `OnCommitPending` hook sets one engine-level event; a pass resets the
  event first (a mid-pass registration re-arms it) then calls
  `FlushPendingCommits()` per storage. Only does work under
  `SqlDatabaseEngineOptions.Durability = Grouped`; the default stays synchronous
  per-commit fsync.
- **`SqlPageWriteBackWorker`** — paced `WriteBackDirtyPages(batch)` per storage per
  pass (`PageWriteBackInterval`/`PageWriteBackBatchSize`).
- **`SqlCheckpointWorker`** — checkpoints **both** file sets of every open database
  per pass (`CheckpointInterval`); a busy storage (`StorageTransactionException`) is
  skipped and retried next pass. The data file set checkpoints **through the
  database's transaction coordinator**, so the truncating checkpoint record
  carries every in-flight logical transaction's sequence (recovery
  classification survives truncation); the catalog file set has no logical
  transactions above it and checkpoints directly.
- **`SqlVersionPurgeWorker` / `SqlIndexMaintenanceWorker`** — documented stubs: the
  engine serializes at page grain (no MVCC version store) and the index layer has no
  compaction yet. They keep the inventory — and any host mapping over it — stable;
  the bodies fill in when those integrations land, without touching the seam.

**Lifecycle (create → use → dispose):** the worker threads live exactly as long
as the engine. Disposal signals the pumps, joins the threads *before* closing
storages (no worker pass may touch a database being disposed), then durably
flushes and closes every open database — an embedded consumer gets identical
durability with no host and no composition at all (R10). A worker fault flips
the engine's observational `State` to `Faulted` without stopping service — a
faulted worker never compromises correctness (grouped commits self-help within
the window; checkpoints simply stop truncating), but the owner can observe the
engine runs degraded. (Previously the fault was thrown from `StopAsync`; with
lifecycle members gone, `State` is the reporting surface — throwing from
`DisposeAsync` would be hostile to `await using`.)

Cadence knobs live here, on `SqlDatabaseEngineOptions` — the engine owns the
loop, so cadence is engine configuration; observers read it through
`IDatabaseEngineWorker.Interval`.

## The per-model server (`SqlDatabaseServer`)

The SQL model ships its own wire-protocol server: `SqlDatabaseServer :
DatabaseServer` (the guided base in `Assimalign.Cohesion.Database.Server` — a
feature-to-feature reference, COHRES-legal), fronting exactly one
`SqlDatabaseEngine` (`Create(engine, options)`). Servers are per-model by
design: this type is where SQL-specific wire behavior grows (typed relational
payloads, SQL transaction frames) as the protocol's model-specific surface
lands; today it adds the typed `Engine` accessor and the composition seam, and
execution rides the base's model-agnostic text-execute path. "Running" lives
here — the engine underneath has no lifecycle; the server starts and stops
around it.

## The application-builder verbs (`AddSqlDatabase`, `AddSqlServer`)

The model registers itself on a database application through two
`extension(IDatabaseApplicationBuilder)` members in `Extensions/`, composing
against the **area root's builder seam only** (this package references no
hosting module; COHRES001 stays intact — the same rule that puts
`AddAuthentication` in `Web.Authentication`, not `Web.Hosting`):

- `AddSqlDatabase(Action<SqlDatabaseEngineOptions>?)` creates and registers the
  engine — operational the moment the verb returns — and returns it (the Web
  convention of returning the feature's own composition object), so a
  composition root can seed or provision databases, or front the engine with a
  server, before the application starts.
- `AddSqlServer(SqlDatabaseEngine, Action<DatabaseServerOptions>)` creates and
  registers a `SqlDatabaseServer` fronting the given engine and returns it. The
  verb composes eagerly — a per-model server needs only its one engine, already
  in hand, so the deferred context-receiving `AddServer` overload exists for
  composition roots with genuinely late-bound decisions, not for model verbs.

Registration is dependency-free: the verbs new the objects up from options and
hand them to `AddEngine`/`AddServer`; no container, no configuration binding.

## Error model

`DatabaseException` (area root) for everything user-facing: plan-time
validation, execution errors, constraint violations (nullability). Parse failures
(`SqlQueryRequest.FromSql`, and therefore the session's text-execute seam) throw
the root's `DatabaseParseException` so callers — the wire-protocol server in
particular — can distinguish fix-the-text errors (`ParseFailure` on the wire)
from execution errors without model knowledge. `SqlCatalogException` (a `DatabaseException`) surfaces
catalog violations unchanged.

## The MVCC integration (scoped under #862)

The engine is the first adopter of the area's transaction-integration design
(`resources/Database/DESIGN.md` §3.8), which closes the isolation split-brain in
four independently shippable steps:

1. **Binding — delivered (#907):** `SqlDatabaseSession` begins an
   `ITransactionContext` on the database's transaction manager alongside the
   storage bracket (one shared sequence), paired through the coordinator's
   `IStorageTransactionSource`; commit/rollback flow through the manager
   (journal-bound log), the storage transaction stays the physical WAL bracket.
   The carried `IsolationLevel` is real per-level snapshot semantics — see
   "Transactions" under the execution model. **Scope decision:** the MVCC
   composition is per **database**, not per engine — the journal binding,
   recovery analysis, and the `OldestActive` prune bound are properties of one
   database's journal and record space; a per-engine manager would couple
   unrelated databases' snapshot horizons.
2. **Row versions + visibility — delivered (#908):** rows in the shared record
   space carry writer/deleter `TransactionSequence` stamps (the B+Tree
   leaf-entry design — tombstone deletes, aborted stamps reverting via page
   images); scans filter through `TransactionSnapshot.IsVisible`, closing the
   dirty-read window. **Version-layout decision:** chains live *in the record
   space itself* (update = tombstone old + insert new) rather than copying old
   versions out to a side store — in-space versions are WAL-covered, so restart
   visibility is correct by construction, no stable row identity is needed
   (the rejected copy-out design required one to key chains across record
   relocation), and the purge worker reclaims dead versions where they lie.
   See "Row format" and "Migration rule" under the execution model.
3. **Row-grain write conflicts (#909):** exclusive hashed-key locks via
   `ILockManager` (the B+Tree uniqueness-lock precedent) replace page conflicts
   as the user-visible surface; deadlock victims surface as
   `DatabaseException`-wrapped aborts at the model boundary.
4. **Version purge (#910):** `SqlVersionPurgeWorker`'s stub body becomes
   `IVersionStore.PurgeWriterAsync` + the `OldestActive` prune bound — the
   worker slot was kept in the inventory precisely so this lands seam-stable.

## Non-goals (current cut)

Joins, grouping/aggregation (beyond `COUNT(*)`), subqueries, secondary-index
usage in plans (the B+Tree infrastructure exists — planner adoption is the next
SQL feature), `Serializable` isolation (rejected at begin), and cost-based
optimization. (Row-level MVCC visibility was a non-goal of the first engine cut
and is now delivered — see "The MVCC integration" above.)
