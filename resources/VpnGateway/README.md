# VpnGateway

VpnGateway is the L3 networking service platform intended to manage tunnels, peers, key exchange policy, route advertisement, and VPN session lifecycle.

The application and builder are fillers pending the area's program.

## Projects

- `Assimalign.Cohesion.VpnGateway` defines the public area-root application and builder contracts.
- `Assimalign.Cohesion.VpnGateway.Hosting` provides the concrete creation entry point and the caller-configurable host-service lifecycle.

## Layering and dependencies

As an L3 service platform, VpnGateway composes the L2 `Assimalign.Cohesion.Hosting` runtime rather than defining its own host lifecycle. Hosting is built on the L1 `Assimalign.Cohesion.Core` foundation; the current area has no additional outside-area runtime dependency.
