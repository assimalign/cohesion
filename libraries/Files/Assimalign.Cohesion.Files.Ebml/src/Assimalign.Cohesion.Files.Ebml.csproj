		<Description>
			A .NET implementation for working with Extensible Binary Meta Language (EBML) format
			as a binary container format designed for audio/video storage. EBML is designed as a binary 
			equivalent to XML and uses a storage-efficient approach to build nested Elements 
			with identifiers, lengths, and values. Similar to how an XML Schema defines the structure 
			and semantics of an XML Document, this document defines how EBML Schemas are created to convey the semantics of an EBML Document.
